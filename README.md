My vimrc uses vim-plug for plugins, first install it like this:

curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

(SUPER SAFE, but, hey, that's the install method...)

Then, in vim, run:

:PlugInstall

You'll also need cscope and clang-format.  clang-format is a bit hit or miss on different versions of Linux - good luck there.

Claude reminds me:

"Then restart Vim for all changes to take effect. The configuration you've shared sets up:

Code formatting with clang-format

Enhanced C syntax highlighting

Tag-based navigation with gutentags

Git diff markers in the gutter

Cscope integration for code navigation

Various keybindings for searching symbols, definitions, and references
"

I suggest asking Claude or googling for more on each of these.  (Seriously, I got these suggested by Claude.)
